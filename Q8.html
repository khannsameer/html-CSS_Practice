      <p>
        Working from home can be both rewarding and challenging. The flexibility
        is great, but distractions can reduce productivity. By setting up a
        dedicated workspace, maintaining a structured schedule, and taking
        regular breaks, you can enhance efficiency.

        "The key to productivity is to eliminate distractions and create an
        environment that fosters focus."

      <p>
        Establishing clear boundaries between work and personal life is
        essential. When you create a habit of starting and ending work at a
        specific time, it becomes easier to maintain a healthy balance.
